# Twitter Bootstrap jQuery Mobile Theme

The title says it all. I thought it would be a fun project to build out a jQuery Mobile theme emulating everyone's favorite hotness, the Twitter Bootstrap UI library. It's not a perfect translation of course, but consider it a work in progress. Download it if you like it. This theme completely replaces the existing jQuery Mobile A - E themes with colors and styles found in Twitter Bootstrap.
